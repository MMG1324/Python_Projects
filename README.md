Finance Management App
This app is based on a GUI object-oriented python code, which gives the user a financial management calculator. 
It helps user keep track of their monthly earnings and expenses without exceeding their budgets. 
Theres three categories in which they can save up different percentages of money earned. Such as Savings account, Phone account, Holidays account.
Whithin these 3 savings accounts the user can organize themselves and make sure to keep track with their monthly income.
Also after each earning or expense, the user gets notified wether their doing a good job or if they need to save more money!
I want this application to be aimed towards University students that way they can have start out and learn how to handle and manage their financial situations.
It will help them know what they can spend on and what they should not spend on, aswell as give them more oportunities to have enough savings for a holiday vacaction.
